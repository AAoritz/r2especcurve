# r2especcurve
A specification curve builder for the R2E project. Uses the data format generated by following the R2E reproduction protocol.

If you are an R user, to use:

1. Do `remotes::install_github('NickCH-K/r2especcurve')`
2. Load up your data and `library(r2especcurve)`.
3. See `help(speccurve)` for example code. You'll need to give it your data set and the column names of your analytical decisions, at least.
